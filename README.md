# ArpanSampleJCloudant Project on IBM Bluemix

This is a sample project created using the IBM Bluemix Java with CloudantDB boilerplate. The project is attached to the DevOps pipeline using the https://hub.jazz.net/git/arpane4c5/ArpanSampleJCloudant repo. The initial commit has the initialized running code same as that of the boilerplate sample. The subsequent commits try to integrate more functionalities like MVC framework, user-defined web pages, integration of libraries/jars and their usage. 

If the recent version of the code does not work, it is recommended that you roll-back to a previous working commit and clone the repo.
